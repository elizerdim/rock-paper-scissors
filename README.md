# Frontend Mentor - Rock, Paper, Scissors game

This is a solution to the [Rock, Paper, Scissors game challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH). I started out with the rock-paper-scissors game project on The Odin Project and used the design on Frontend Mentor for the UI. I also followed along with the instructions on The Odin Project to learn branching in Git.
